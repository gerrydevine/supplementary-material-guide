Research material that is supplementary to your thesis can be of variety of forms. It may for example be:
- Raw __data__ that was collected as part of your research
- Analysed __data__ generated from raw data analysis, or __data__ that underlies graphs or charts that exist within your thesis.
- __Media__ that could not be included directly within your thesis document, but is an important part of the research being presented. This could include collections of images, video files, animations, or audio files.
- __Analysis scripts__. This could for example be R or Python scripts used to generate the graphs presented in your thesis.
